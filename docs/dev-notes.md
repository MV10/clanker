* An image attachment may take some time to download. Attempts to retrieve it too early will fail. Need more research to understand what the LLM sees (bad URI?).

* Optionally allow Clankers to be named? Scan the message sidebar to look for real username conflicts? What about conflicts with multiple Clankers by the same name in the conversation?

* Provide a context menu Diagnostics -> "Edit Conversation State" page to allow the user to modify the active conversation's stored summary, customization, and profile data. Include Save button (do not save changes automatically; user can close the page to cancel). Also show read-only runtime state and recent messages list below the edit/save area (same outputs as provided on the Show Conversation State page).

* Parsed message data doesn't capture reply-to relationships.
