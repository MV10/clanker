# Enhancements, Ideas, etc.

* Dual model support (cheap text-only, more expensive image support only when needed)

* For long-running conversations, have the LLM generate and update notes about each participant, areas of interest, etc, and store these with conversation data, and send them with each request.
 
* During long idle periods, scan for recent events of interest and decide whether to comment about it in the chat

* Does a DOM change in disregarded areas of the UI such as the conversation-list sidebar also trigger the extension?

* Add Diagnostics menu item "Show Sanitized Conversation State" for public sharing for support requests; change participant names to User001 amd User002 etc, and change phone number participant names to (001) XXX-XXX and (002) XXX-XXXX etc, also redact image blob URI GUIDs with Xs.

* Improve icon legibility (fewer colors, more contrast).
