* Automated-message accounts are not necessarily 10 digits as previously assumed from the teclo's name for the feature (A2P 10DLC). Change how these are recognized so that the rules apply to any participant with a numbers-only name consisting of 1 to 10 digits, not only 10 digits.

* Optionally allow Clankers to be named? Scan the message sidebar to look for real username conflicts? What about conflicts with multiple Clankers by the same name in the conversation?
