# Enhancements, Ideas, etc.

* Dual model support (cheap text-only, more expensive image support only when needed)

* For long-running conversations, take notes about participants areas of interest
* During long idle periods, scan for recent events of interest and decide whether to comment about it in the chat
* Notes about interests are restricted by conversation, the same user in a different chat will have separate data

* Add Diagnostics menu item "Show Sanitized Conversation State" for public sharing for support requests; change participant names to User001 amd User002 etc, and change phone number participant names to (001) XXX-XXX and (002) XXX-XXXX etc, also redact image blob URI GUIDs with Xs.

* When reporting participants to the LLM, replace "You" with the user's configured name.

* Improve icon legibility (fewer colors, more contrast).
